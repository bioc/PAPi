Description: The Pathway Activity Profiling - PAPi - is an R package for predicting the activity of metabolic pathways based solely on a metabolomics data set containing a list of metabolites identified and their respective abundances in different biological samples. PAPi generates hypothesis that improves the final biological interpretation. See Aggio, R.B.M; Ruggiero, K. and Villas-Boas, S.G. (2010) - Pathway Activity Profiling (PAPi): from metabolite profile to metabolic pathway activity. Bioinformatics.
